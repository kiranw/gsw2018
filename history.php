      <h2>Our History</h2>

      <p>The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was <strong>founded in 1997</strong> when the MIT $50K (now $100K) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from organizations around the world interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs).</p>

      <p>The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1998, and brought together an international community committed to launching BPCs to stimulate and nurture entrepreneurship worldwide.</p>

      <p>A decade later, having helped grow and mature the BPC community, MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Today we continue to build stronger, more productive entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world and a diverse and dynamic global support network for entrepreneurs.</p>
